# Project Mission & Summary

With this project I would like to promote digital sovereignity in German schools. The main idea is to design and offer an open online course for teachers in order to learn the bascs of using the internet in a self determined way. This course will be lead to a follow-up project, in which teachers can participate together with their classes.
